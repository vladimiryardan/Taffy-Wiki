# So you want to... (Index)

This page lists a bunch of tasks you might want to complete while coding with Taffy, and links to subpages explaining how you can accomplish each of them. It was created as part of Taffy 1.1, so directions here may not always work for Taffy 1.0.

## Index:

1. [Create a dead-simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API for one resource (aka table of data)][1]
1. [Serialize your data to a format other than the default of JSON][2]
1. [Serialize your return data to multiple formats (json, xml, ...)][3]
1. [Require an API key][4]
1. [Rate-limit access to your API][5]
1. [Use JSONUtil instead of ColdFusion's native JSON serialization][6]
1. [todo] Share application variables between your API and your consumer-facing application
1. [Use Taffy's built-in Dependency Injection to resolve dependencies of your resources][8]
1. [Use an external bean factory (like ColdSpring) to resolve dependencies of your resources][9]
1. [todo] Use an external bean factory (like ColdSpring) to completely manage resources
1. [todo] Use ColdSpring AOP advice for your resources
1. [todo] Write your components using ColdFusion 9+ "script component" syntax
1. [todo] Upload a file via your API
