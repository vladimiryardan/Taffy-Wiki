This page shows how to implement a REST API using Taffy. For an index of documentation, see the [[Home]] page, and for a high level explanation of Taffy, see the "project homepage":http://atuttle.github.com/Taffy/.

By and large, Taffy uses convention over configuration, but there are a few configuration details that can't be pragmatically solved with conventions. In those cases, configuration is needed, but minimal.

h1. Step 0: Installing Taffy

Simply unzip the @taffy@ folder into your webroot. An application-specific mapping to a non-web-accessible folder is not sufficient; however a global mapping in your ColdFusion Administrator will work -- in which case you should map @/taffy@ to the location of your unzipped @taffy@ folder.

h1. Step 1: Application.cfc

Much like a "FW/1":http://fw1.riaforge.org/ application, Taffy implements a majority of its logic in Application.cfc, as a base class that the Application.cfc of your application will extend. At a minimum, your APIs Application.cfc needs the following:

pre. component extends="taffy.core.api" {
	this.name = hash(getCurrentTemplatePath());
	void function applicationHook(){
		registerMimeType("json", "text/json");
	}
	void function registerURIs(){
		//let taffy know about the cfcs in your api so that it can map URIs to them
		addURI("taffy.example.api.artistCollection");
		addURI("taffy.example.api.artistMember");
		//...
	}
}

* Application.cfc extends @taffy.core.api@

* Application name is unique

* DO NOT implement the @onApplicationStart@, @onRequestStart@, or @onRequest@ methods; these are used by the framework. @ApplicationHook@ is called during @onApplicationStart@, and @requestHook@ is called during @onRequestStart@, if you need to add code to these event listeners.

* @applicationHook@ method is used to set any application-specific variables, as well as register Mime Types that your API supports (more on this later), and set values for some special url parameters (see: "setDebugKey":http://, "setReloadKey":http://, "setReloadPassword":http://)

* @registerURIs@ is a special method called during framework initialization that inspects the metadata from each of your CFCs and caches some information to enable requests to be properly routed. Inside this function, use the "addURI":http:// method to notify the framework about each CFC in your API. Pass the dot-notation path of the CFC to the @addURI@ method.

Of course, there are a few more things you can do. The [[Index of API Methods]] lists all methods, what they do, and where you can use them.

h1. Step 2: Implement API Resources as CFCs

Each resource in your API (eg. Artists, Art) should be defined as its own CFC. In a Taffy API, *you implement Collections and Members as separate CFCs* (eg. @artistCollection.cfc@ and @artistMember.cfc@). They won't be exposed by name via the framework, so you can name them whatever you like. In addition, if you like, your API CFCs may be outside the web-root, as long as they are accessible via CF mappings. Application-specific mappings are acceptable in this case.

Here is an example resource implementation:

*artCollection.cfc:*

pre. component extends="taffy.core.restapi" taffy_uri="/artists/{artistId}/art" {
	public function get(string city = ""){
		//query the database for matches, making use of optional parameter "city"
		return representationOf(queryObject).withStatus(200);
	}
}

* Each CFC extends @taffy.core.restapi@.

* Each CFC should implement _up to_ 4 methods: *get*, *post*, *put*, and *delete*. As you may have guessed, these map directly to the HTTP verb used by the api consumer.<br/><br/>
** If the consumer uses the PUT verb, it runs the PUT method in the corresponding CFC. <br/><br/>
** Since the POST, PUT, and DELETE methods are not implemented in the example above, the POST, PUT, and DELETE verbs will be refused (with HTTP status code 405 Not Allowed) for the corresponding resource.

* Tokens from the component attribute @taffy_uri@, defined as @{token_name}@ (including the curly braces, see example above) will be extracted from the URI and passed by name to the requested method. In addition, all query string parameters (except those defined for debugging and reloading) will also be included in the argument collection sent to the method. <br/><br/>For example: @GET /artist/44/art?city=Philadelphia@ will result in the GET method being called, with the arguments: @{ artistId: 44, city: "Philadelphia" }@.<br/><br/>The @artistId@ parameter is defined by the @taffy_uri@ attribute *of the component (not the function)*, and the @city@ parameter is defined as an optional argument to the function, and was provided in the query string.

* The @representationOf@ method is a special method provided by the @restapi@ base class that creates a new object instance capable of serializing your data into the appropriate format. A generic class capable of serializing as JSON is included with the framework and used by default. To use a custom object, pass the dot-notation CFC path to your custom representation object as the 2nd argument to the @representationOf@ method. (It is also planned to implement a global default representation object override, but that is not yet available.) See [[Using a Custom Representation Class]] for more details.
