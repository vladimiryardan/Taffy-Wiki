Hi there. If you're looking for some high level information on Taffy, you should check out the "project homepage":http://atuttle.github.com/Taffy/

To see exactly what's required to implement a REST API with Taffy, check out the [[Getting Started]] page.

There is also an [[Index of API Methods]] that documents what each does and how to work with it.
